In order to run my files, use g++. I compiled each cpp file on its own and then ran it by itself.
For example (if I want to run insertsort.cpp):
	g++ insertsort.cpp
	./a.out
This should print the sorted list to the appropriate file.

In order to test the runtimes of my files, I just hard coded in the values I wanted to be tested. I changed the size of the array and how many times it looped to fill the array with random numbers. I also changed the value that was passed into the sorting algorithm in order to have it match up with how many elements are in the array.

I compile the mergeTime.cpp and the insertTime.cpp the same way as my other files.

Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to properly read the files so my sorting only does the first line of each file. My sorting works, my file i/o does not work 100%.
