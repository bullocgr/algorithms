NearestNighbor:
    In order to run my NearestNighbor.py (the source file for the algorithm), I used the command:
        python NearestNighbor.py <input file>.txt

    Doing this will result in the time being printed to the terminal and the solution being printed to
    <input file>.txt.tour.

    When testing if the solutions matched the expected, I would run this command:
        python tsp-verifier.py <input file>.txt <input file>.txt.tour

    This will result in a message in the terminal stating whether or not the solutions matched the expected
    output.
