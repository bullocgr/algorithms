Knapsack:
    In order to run my knapsack.cpp, I used the command:
        g++ knapsack.cpp
        ./a.out
    When I wanted to change the amount of items, I just changed the value of n at the end of the for loop in the main. 
    When I wanted to change the capacity, I uncommented the W at the end of the for loop and put in the desired amount.
    When I wanted to run just the DP algorithm (if the recursive one was too slow), I would comment out int R (line 37)
and float RTime (line 36) as well as commenting out lines 45 and 46.

Shopping:
    In order to run my shopping.cpp, I used the command:
        g++ shopping.cpp
        ./a.out
    This will print everything to a file called results.txt.
